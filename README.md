# Open Source Pledge Accounts

This repository contains the accounts/bookkeeping for the Open Source Pledge.

## Team Members

All team members are contractors (of Functional Software Inc. dba Sentry—we're bootstrapping for now, will spin out a 
new entity when it makes sense). Team members and their hourly rates are listed in [team.csv](./team.csv). Everyone 
sets their own rate. To join the team chip in on [open 
issues](https://github.com/opensourcepledge/opensourcepledge.com/issues) and we'll invite you to make a PR to add 
yourself to `team.csv`.

## Accounts (Bookkeeping)

The accounts are kept by Sentry. We intend to publish regular reports for transparency.

## Submitting Expenses

Provided you are in [team.csv](./team.csv), to submit expenses, send an invoice to
<ap@sentry.io>, cc'ing <chadwhitacre@sentry.io>. Specify "Due on receipt" to be paid promptly.

Labor costs should be based on an hourly rate. Hours spent should be tracked using one invoice line item per task. The
tasks do not have to be extremely granular, but it is good to know approximately which costs are associated with which
work. We recommend 15-minute rounding.

Invoices can also contain reimbursement requests for reasonable expenses made on behalf of the Pledge — printing
stickers, perhaps attending a conference.

## Budget

Pledge core team is ultimately responsible for managing the budget. Our intent is to be transparent so that the whole 
team can make informed decisions together—i.e., please don't submit really large or surprising invoices or we won't be 
able to sustain ourselves.
